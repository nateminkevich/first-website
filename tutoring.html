            Outside of school I am heavily involved in Taekwondo as well as solving Rubik's Cubes, also known as Speedcubing. I am involved in Taekwondo as a both a student and a volunteer assistant instructor, teaching young students what I was taught when I began my journey in Taekwondo.

          <p style="text-align: left;">Through my volunteer work as a Taekwondo Instuctor, I have learned first hand what it is like to communicate with childern of all ages and keep them engaged when learning new things.
