          <h3 style="text-align: left;">About Me:</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;">I'm Nate Minkevich, a 17 year old High School Senior currently attending Sato Academy of Mathematics and Science in Long Beach, California. 
            I first began speedcubing in December 2017 and went to my first competition in June of the following year. I have been an active competitor ever since and have competed in a total of 35 competitions, two of which I organized.
            Throughout my time cubing, I have been particularly interested in the Blindfolded events, having learned how to solve it within the first week of the 2020 lockdown. 
            In addition to speedcubing, I am heavily involved in Taekwondo as a both a Black Belt and a volunteer Assistant Instructor, teaching young students what I was taught when I began my journey in Taekwondo. 
          </p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Why Me?</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Through my volunteer work as a Taekwondo Instuctor, I have learned first hand what it is like to teach childern of all ages and keep them engaged in the process.
            Through offering my coaching services, I hope to spread my love of Blindfolded Speedcubing to new people and show others that anything is possible. I am not just qualified through my ability to teach however, 
          but also my expertise in Blindfolded events. My passion for Blindfolded has transferred into results, as I currently hold personal records of 39.61 Seconds for 3x3 Blindfolded Single, 58.97 Seconds for 3x3 Blindfolded Mean of 3 Solves, and 9/10 Cubes in 41:25 for the Multiple Cubes Blindfolded Event.
          This has led me to earning Silver and Bronze Medals in Blindfolded events, as well as placing 9th in 3x3 Blindfolded at the CubingUSA Western Championship 2023.</p>
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">What will coaching provide me?</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Learning to solve the Rubik's Cube Blindfolded is one of the most daunting tasks a speedcuber will have to navigate. Through my coaching, I aim to offer a clear roadmap to learning Blindfolded solving while achieving real results not just quickly, but effectively.
            For seasoned Blindfolded solvers, I also serve to give them critques of their solutions and provide them with new techniques and strategies to incorporate into their solves. </p>
